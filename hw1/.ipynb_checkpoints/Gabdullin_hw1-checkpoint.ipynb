general quality argument found poor   this article attempts provide gentle introduction logic  hope improving general level debate   logic science reasoning  proof  thinking  inference  concise    logic allows analyze piece reasoning determine whether correct  valid invalid    course  does need study logic order reason correctly  nevertheless  little basic knowledge logic often helpful when constructing analyzing argument   note that claim being made here about whether logic universally applicable   matter very much open debate   this document merely explains use logic  given that have already decided that logic right tool the   propositions  statements  the building blocks logical argument  proposition statement which either true false  example   raining   today tuesday    propositions either asserted  said true  denied  said false    note that this technical meaning  deny   the everyday meaning   proposition meaning statement  the particular arrangement words used express    exists   there exists  both express same proposition   argument  quote monty python sketch   connected series statements establish definite proposition    argument consists three stages   first  propositions which necessary the argument continue stated   these called premises argument   they the evidence reasons accepting argument its conclusions    premises  assertions  often indicated phrases such  because    since    obviously  on    phrase  obviously  often viewed with suspicion  can used intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises   something doesn seem obvious  be afraid question   can always    right  obvious  when heard explanation    next  premises used derive further propositions process known inference   inference  proposition arrived the basis more other propositions already accepted   there various forms valid inference   propositions arrived inference then used further inference   inference often denoted phrases such  implies that   therefore    finally  arrive conclusion argument    proposition which affirmed basis premises inference   conclusions often indicated phrases such  therefore    follows that    conclude  on   conclusion often stated final stage inference   example   every event cause  premise  universe beginning  premise  beginnings involve event  premise  this implies that beginning universe involved event  inference  therefore universe cause  inference conclusion   note that conclusion argument might premise another argument   proposition only called premise conclusion with respect particular argument  terms make sense isolation   sometimes argument will follow order given above  example  conclusions might stated first the premises stated  afterwards support conclusion   this perfectly valid   sometimes little confusing   recognizing argument much harder than recognizing premises conclusions   many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which might reasonably describe argument   some statements look like arguments  are   example    bible accurate  jesus must either have been insane  evil liar   son    this argument  conditional statement   does assert premises which necessary support what appears its  conclusion    also suffers from number other logical flaws  ll come those later    another example    created  therefore your duty    phrase  your duty  proposition  since neither true false   therefore not conclusion  the sentence argument   finally  causality important   consider statement form  because    interested establishing is offered evidence  statement argument   trying establish truth  then not argument  explanation   example    there must something wrong with engine car  because will  start      this argument    will start because there something wrong with engine       this explanation   there two traditional types argument  deductive inductive   deductive argument which provides conclusive proof conclusions    that  argument where premises true  conclusion must also true   deductive argument either valid invalid   valid argument defined where premises true  then conclusion true   inductive argument where premises provide some evidence the truth conclusion   inductive arguments not valid invalid  however  talk about whether they better worse than other arguments  about probable their premises   there forms argument ordinary language which neither deductive inductive   however  will concentrate the moment deductive arguments  they often viewed most rigorous convincing   important note that fact that deductive argument valid does imply that conclusion holds   this because slightly  counter intuitive nature implication  which must consider more carefully   obviously valid argument consist true propositions   however  argument entirely valid even contains only false propositions   example      insects have wings  premise     woodlice insects  premise     therefore woodlice have wings  conclusion   here  conclusion true because argument premises false   argument premises were true  however  conclusion would true   argument thus entirely valid   more subtly  reach true conclusion from more false premises       fish live sea  premise     dolphins fish  premise     therefore dolphins live sea  conclusion   however  one thing cannot reach false conclusion through valid inference from true premises   therefore draw  truth table  implication   symbol      denotes implication    premise    conclusion       represent true false respectively   premise conclusion inference                                                                       premises false the inference                        valid  conclusion true false                          premises true the conclusion

whose premises true   sound  argument therefore arrives true conclusion   careful confuse valid arguments with sound arguments   delve further into structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy   simpler probably more useful summarize major pitfalls avoided when constructing argument   these pitfalls known fallacies   everyday english term  fallacy  used refer mistaken beliefs well the faulty reasoning that leads those beliefs   this fair enough  logic term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument  especially argument appears valid convincing   the purposes this discussion  define fallacy logical argument which appears correct  which seen incorrect when examined more closely   studying fallacies avoid being misled them   following list fallacies intended exhaustive   argumentum baculum  appeal force   appeal force committed when arguer resorts force threat force order and push acceptance conclusion   often used politicians  can summarized  might makes right    force threatened need a direct threat from arguer   example       thus there ample proof truth bible   those refuse accept that truth will burn hell    argumentum hominem  argumentum hominem literally  argument directed man    abusive variety argumentum hominem occurs when  instead trying disprove truth assertion  arguer attacks person people making assertion   this invalid because truth assertion does depend upon goodness those asserting   example   atheism evil philosophy   practised communists murderers    sometimes court doubt cast upon testimony witness  showing  example  that known perjurer   this valid reducing credibility testimony given witness  not argumentum hominem  however  does demonstrate that witness testimony false   conclude otherwise fall victim argumentum ignorantiam  elsewhere this list    circumstantial form argumentum hominem committed when person argues that opponent ought accept truth assertion because opponent particular circumstances   example   perfectly acceptable kill animals food   can argue otherwise when quite happy wear leather shoes    this abusive charge inconsistency  used excuse dismissing opponent argument   this fallacy also used means rejecting conclusion    example    course would argue that positive discrimination bad thing   white    this particular form argumentum hominem  when alleges that adversary rationalizing conclusion formed from selfish interests  also known  poisoning well    argumentum ignorantium  argumentum ignorantium means  argument from ignorance    this fallacy occurs whenever argued that something must true simply because not been proved false    equivalently  when argued that something must false because not been proved true    note that this the same assuming that something false until been proved true  basic scientific principle    examples   course bible true   nobody prove otherwise     course telepathy other psychic phenomena exist   nobody shown proof that they real    note that this fallacy does apply court  where generally assumed innocent until proven guilty   also  scientific investigation known that event would produce certain evidence having occurred  absence such evidence  validly used infer that event not occur   example    flood described bible would require enormous volume water present earth   earth does have tenth much water  even count that which frozen into the poles   therefore such flood occurred    science  validly assume from lack evidence that something not occurred   cannot conclude with certainty that not occurred  however   argumentum misericordiam  this appeal pity  also known special pleading   fallacy  committed when arguer appeals pity the sake getting  conclusion accepted   example    not murder mother father with   please find guilty  suffering enough through being orphan    argumentum populum  this known appealing gallery  appealing people   commit this fallacy attempt acceptance assertion appealing large group people   this form fallacy often characterized emotive language   example    pornography must banned   violence against women     bible must true   millions people know that   you trying tell them that they all mistaken fools    argumentum numeram  this fallacy closely related argumentum populum   consists asserting that more people support believe proposition  more likely that that proposition correct   argumentum verecundiam  appeal authority uses admiration famous and support assertion   example    isaac newton genius believed    this line argument always completely bogus  example  reference admitted authority particular field relevant discussion that subject   example  distinguish quite clearly between    stephen hawking concluded that black holes give radiation   john searle concluded that impossible build intelligent  computer   hawking physicist  we reasonably expect opinions black hole radiation informed   searle linguist  questionable  whether well qualified speak subject machine intelligence   fallacy accident  fallacy accident committed when general rule applied particular case whose  accidental  circumstances mean that rule inapplicable   the error made when goes from general specific   example    christians generally dislike atheists   are christian  must dislike atheists    this fallacy often committed moralists legalists try decide every moral legal question mechanically applying general rules   converse accident   hasty generalization  this fallacy reverse fallacy accident   occurs when forms general rule examining only specific cases which not representative possible cases   example   bakker insincere christian   therefore christians insincere    sweeping generalization   dicto simpliciter  sweeping generalization occurs when general rule applied particular situation which features that particular situation render rule inapplicable   sweeping generalization opposite hasty generalization   causa causa   post ergo propter  these known false cause fallacies   fallacy causa causa occurs when identifies something cause event has actually been shown the cause    example    took aspirin prayed  headache disappeared   cured the headache    fallacy post ergo propter occurs when something assumed the cause event merely because happened before event    example    soviet union collapsed after taking atheism   therefore must avoid atheism the same reasons    hoc ergo propter  this fallacy similar post ergo propter   asserts that because events occur together  they must causally related  leaves room other factors that the cause  events   petitio principii  this fallacy occurs when premises least questionable conclusion reached   circulus demonstrando  this fallacy occurs when assumes premise conclusion which wishes reach   often  proposition will rephrased that fallacy appears valid argument   example    homosexuals must allowed hold government office   hence government official revealed homosexual will lose job   therefore homosexuals will anything hide their secret  will open blackmail   therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold government office    note that argument entirely circular  premise same  conclusion   argument like above actually been cited reason the british secret services  official homosexual employees   another example classic    know that exists because bible tells   know that bible true because the word    complex question   fallacy interrogation  this fallacy presupposition   example classic loaded  question    have stopped beating your wife    question presupposes definite answer another question which not even been asked   this trick often used lawyers cross examination  when they questions like    where you hide money stole    similarly  politicians often loaded questions such    long will this interference affairs allowed continue    does chancellor plan more years ruinous privatization    ignoratio elenchi  fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming that argument  supports particular conclusion when actually logically nothing with that conclusion   example  christian begin saying that will argue that teachings christianity undoubtably true   then argues length that christianity great help many people  matter well argues will have shown that christian teachings true   sadly  such fallacious arguments often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others view supposed conclusion more favourable light   equivocation  equivocation occurs when word used with more different meanings same argument   example    what could more affordable than free software   make sure that remains free  that users what they like with  must place license make sure that will always freely redistributable    amphiboly  amphiboly occurs when premises used argument ambiguous because careless ungrammatical phrasing   accent  accent another form fallacy through shifting meaning   this case  meaning changed altering which parts statement emphasized   example  consider    should speak our friends   should speak our friends   fallacies composition  fallacy composition conclude that property shared parts something must apply whole   example    bicycle made entirely mass components  therefore very  lightweight    other fallacy composition conclude that property number individual items shared collection those items   example    uses less petrol causes less pollution than   therefore cars less environmentally damaging than buses    fallacy division  fallacy division opposite fallacy composition   like opposite  exists varieties   first assume that property some thing must apply parts   example    are studying rich college   therefore must rich    other assume that property collection items shared each item   example    ants destroy tree   therefore this can destroy tree    slippery slope argument  this argument states that should event occur  will other harmful events   there proof made that harmful events caused first event   example   legalize marijuana  then would have legalize crack heroin ll have nation full drug addicts welfare   therefore cannot legalize marijuana     based  fallacies    type  fallacies  these fallacies occur when attempts argue that things some similar without actually specifying what they similar   examples   history based upon faith    then the bible also form history     islam based faith  christianity based faith  islam form christianity     cats form animal based carbon chemistry  dogs form animal based carbon chemistry  aren dogs form    affirmation consequent  this fallacy argument form  implies  true  therefore true    understand is fallacy  examine truth table implication given earlier   denial antecedent  this fallacy argument form  implies  false  therefore false    again  truth table implication makes clear this fallacy   note that this fallacy different from causa causa  latter the form  implies  false  therefore false   where does fact imply all   here  problem that implication invalid  rather that falseness does allow deduce anything about   converting conditional  this fallacy argument form  then  therefore then    argumentum antiquitam  this fallacy asserting that something right good simply because old  because  that way always been    argumentum novitam  this opposite argumentum antiquitam  the fallacy asserting that something more correct simply because new newer than something else   argumentum crumenam  fallacy believing that money criterion correctness  that those with more money more likely right   argumentum lazarum  fallacy assuming that because someone poor she sounder more virtuous than who wealthier   this fallacy opposite argumentum crumenam   argumentum nauseam  this incorrect belief that assertion more likely true more often heard    argumentum nauseum  that employs constant repetition asserting something   bifurcation  also referred the  black white  fallacy  bifurcation occurs when presents situation having only alternatives  where fact other alternatives exist exist   plurium interrogationum   many questions  this fallacy occurs when questioner demands simple answer complex question   sequitur  sequitur argument where conclusion drawn from premises which not logically connected with   herring  this fallacy committed when irrelevant material introduced issue being discussed  that everyone attention diverted away from points being made  towards different conclusion   reification   hypostatization  reification occurs when abstract concept treated concrete thing   shifting burden proof  burden proof always person making assertion proposition   shifting burden proof  special case argumentum ignorantium  fallacy putting burden proof person denies questions assertion being made   source fallacy assumption that something true unless proven otherwise   straw  straw fallacy misrepresent someone else position that attacked more easily  then knock down that misrepresented position  then conclude that original position been demolished   fallacy because fails deal with actual arguments that have been made   extended analogy  fallacy extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule being argued over   fallacy assume that mentioning  different situations  argument about general rule  constitutes  claim that those situations analogous each other   this fallacy best explained using real example from debate about  anti cryptography legislation    believe always wrong oppose law breaking     such position odious  implies that would have supported  martin luther king     you saying that cryptography legislation important  struggle black liberation   dare    quoque  this famous  too  fallacy   occurs when action argued acceptable because other party performed   instance    just being randomly abusive      been abusive  ',\n",

ineligible   revenue nothing with     yeah  right    apparently  some congressmen think stupid enough swallow argument that preferable process 1 6 million renewals every cycle vague hope catching recent felon than simply take goddamn card away from criminal conviction time   usual  hassle law abiding instead crook   two chairs committee were  caron sen  jujuga  jujuga didn much  co sponsor both  restraining order  bills  caron struck sharp that wouldn any logic lies part either side unchallenged     co sponsor the  restraining order  bills well    the younger reps committee  forgot name

these   staffer attorney general harshbarger testified favor this anti bill  saying 50 000 restraining orders were granted last year  how these women needed protected   caron noted that restraining order granted 10 days  then hearing held determine whether order would extended year   asked whether would satisfied fid were revoked time this hearing rather than after initial issuance fid   gave some long rambling circumlocution response   then testimony against bill heard   mike yacino  looks something like einstein  and made point that restraining orders were issued little evidence  that judges like issue restraining orders just things cool matter they think right  woman   that hearings restraining orders lightning sessions with little time consider facts  atty  karen mcnutt spoke with few times during testimony   other gunners to testify   said had file restraining order against tenant clear out  that countered filing against   noted that this would have allowed state confiscate guns new bill became  the junior reps noted that  this america  have certain that individual rights respected   senator jujuga reiterated this  saying that  people abuse smaller people to hell i care  have careful about equating conviction with restraining order     point match  senator    another gunner and testified that didn know citizenship  expired every 5 years   that driver

again    four five other kids testified favor this bill  spilling tears the good legislators   the students actually shot wayne also there   many them shirts  saying   long person buy anger  none are safe    support control    committee reluctant grill correct kids  except caron  corrected student had claimed that anyone could apply fid    only residents get   said    much want that this had idea been conned into testifying bill that would out staters completely    yacino mcnutt spoke again  this time noting that bill written would affect both ammo all guns possessed staters   karen also noted that hunters   could away year they wandered across boundary somewhere woods got challenged game wardens   yacino underscored fact that could have gotten a resident student     hell  even  had criminal mental record   junior was upset that would take residents longer gun than staters  thought  elitist    another  caron   said that need protection preventing residents from buying without because only other states union  type  cards  complying with the laws home state  enough    pro speaker replied that this resembled mother watching son marching band exclaiming   everyone step johnny    the bard college people were filing the gun testimony this bill made  thus only gunners were around when other bills came under consideration   main bills remaining  goal position  were    4375 four others  notify police chiefs they pull     licenses when holder convicted  strongly supported    1732  require trigger locks handguns sold  opposed    962  require trigger locks loaded firearms  strongly    opposed    1350  allow every municipality enact their gun laws      opposed    1731  fund bullet proof vests municipal police  supported    1097  state constitutional amendment the rkba  supported    several police discretion issuance cards  opposed    several altering resident license conditions  supported    1135  damn near guns everywhere state  guess    some these took only 30 seconds consider  remaining gunners raised hands unison either against them   mike yacino noted that  besides danger screwing with trigger lock loaded  that bill would make illegal licensee carry concealed handgun unless were locked   caron blew right through 1350 when that opposed  again  brought state archaic records capability said   this would create hundreds different licensing systems

dread will have been deserted     matthew homes just sentence that italics   further  hebrew word  almah    young woman   specifically   virgin     this prophecy about messiah   not prophecy about event happen 750 years later   not prophecy about virgin  bethulah  mother   short  about jesus   matthew made a verse context  tries make the specific case mary   should noted that want read prophecy general manner  very general  made mary   mary  virgin  indeed young woman with child   course  fit shady has problems   jesus  while thought later christians d walking among  never called name  immanuel   christianity wished claim this prophecy jesus  becomes best and paste prophecy    second class prophecy    too convincing   egypt          after jesus birth bethlehem  matthew tells about quick  elsewhere unmentioned  excursion egypt  wishes liken jesus moses   this done escape alleged infanticidal rampage king  herod           2 15      remained there until death        herod   this fulfil what lord spoken          egypt have led     what lord really said this           hosea 11 1   when israel child  loved           egypt called   more called        them  people   more they went from  they        kept sacrificing als  kept burning        incense idols   matthew conveniently omits rest hosea oracle    indeed israel that  once called egypt  wanted return   this history   jesus certainly being spoken here    are draw some kind parallel here  wind with jesus that flees resists    again  this prophecy just convincing matthew probably hoped   rachel weeps           while jesus vacationing egypt  matthew says that king herod sought kill  thus ordered executions young male children   matthew then writes           2 17 18    this  that which spoken        prophet jeremiah fulfilled           voice heard ramah  wailing loud        lamentation   rachel weeping her children         refused consoled  because they were        more       reference passage jeremiah 31 15  referring carrying israel into exile sargon  assyria  722   rachel  ancestor major tribes israel  ephraim  manasseh  said weep her descendants are  more    metaphorical  course  since rachel lived dies before hebrews were even egyptian exile         interesting note that leah  rachel  was ancestor judeans  land where jesus bethlehem were    anyone should weeping her  children   leah   only connexion that rachel with bethlehem that legends have that was buried north city   way ephrath   bethlehem           herod his infanticide  rather unlikely that such event actually occurred   never knows  the event mentioned alluded anywhere else bible  it mentioned the secular records time   herod particularly unliked reign  many less evil deeds herod were carefully recorded   this might prime example events were added jesus life enhance message church gospel         because whole story similarity tale infant moses egypt  highly likely that device by matthew prophetic  artificial  approval jesus  not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects mention rest jeremiah quote     children  prophet speaks not dead  exiled assyrian empire   comforts weeping rachel  saying that children will returned   will gather them back together   course  this would suit matthew purpose  children speaks dead good   again   prophecy  matthew sets not even that  anyone bothers check  too convincing   nazarene          not even have the next chapter find another matthean prophecy   after leaving egypt  joseph   wife take infant jesus live city nazareth            2 23      that what spoken the prophets        might fulfilled   shall called nazarene    first thing notice that matthew does mention name prophet  this time   second  have who     there messianic prophecies speaking nazarene   worse  there prophecies  period  mentioning nazarene   still worse  there nazarenes mentioned old testament   book judges  angel tells samson mother that will           judges 13 5       conceive bear

matthew begun overboard and paste prophecies  that simple making them   bearing diseases          jesus next goes around healing people physical illnesses disabilities           8 17    this fulfil what spoken        prophet isaiah   took infirmities bore        diseases    expected  verse quoted isaiah quoted context  few words skewed the christian scheme   have           53 4   surely   suffering servant          borne sickness  carried pains   from reading surrounding passages isaiah  know that prophet speaking present tense collective nation israel  jehovah chosen servant people   speaks israelites suffering exile  voice gentile nations that look upon   this image deeply ingrained jewish identity   image chastised  cherished  israel instrument nations  salvation        verses speak israel taking sicknesses which the literal metaphorical manifestations guilt discipline   they speak  servant  going around healing people   notice that servant isaiah takes sicknesses pains nations  individual jews    jesus  all know  not take diseases onto himself   verses here isaiah not prophecy something come  rather something that already happened   while believed that jesus took eternal punishment hell  not bear illnesses healed    while someone might want that  figuratively  jesus reenacted deeds israel spiritual atonement  admit that matthew parallel misses where intended have effect    silent messiah         upon healing multitudes commoners  said that jesus ordered them keep quiet  presumable that wouldn arouse attention local rulers           12 15 21   this fulfill what spoken        prophet isaiah              behold servant whom have chosen  beloved         with whom soul pleased   will spirit         will announce justice gentiles          will wrangle aloud  will anyone hear        voice streets   will break bruised        reed quench smoldering wick until brings        justice victory  the gentiles will hope        name    isaiah passage quoted reads

    await law   see  matthew conveniently left part passage  because does suit dealings jesus   christians could never think jesus failing  never would  light  mankind burn dimly    servant nation israel will indeed come end when job done   when gentiles come embrace there will longer chosen people  rather will children   also  ending phrase been changed from judaic     coastlands await law   christologic   gentiles will hope name     while original proclaims torah jehovah  other rewrites fit strange doctrine  believing name    has doubt servant referred not jesus  has only read whole chapter  isaiah 42  hear about beloved blind imperfect servant   people robbed plundered        that when matthew attempt  prophecy  examined  crumbles   three days three nights         come upon prophecy supposedly uttered very mouth god jesus himself   speaks crucifixion resurrection           12 40    jonah the belly        whale three days three nights  will son        in heart earth three days        three nights   before further discussion occur  necessary know the jews understood days   day names went  each 24 hours long  lasting from sunset 6pm following sunset 6pm   what referred   the period light from 6am ending sunset 6pm   thus  according time scale  sabbath began 6pm friday evening  lasted until 6pm saturday evening   this the jews celebrate their sabbath daylight portion saturdays  instead sundays    seems like real miracle that christians didn forget that saturday indeed seventh last the week    thus  when days nights referred together  12 hour daylight portions 12 hour night periods being spoken   thus  jesus says that will the grave  hell  otherwise unresurrected three days three nights         good book tells  jesus crucified  ninth hour   which 3pm  friday afternoon   then put into grave sometime after that   then  jesus left grave   rose   before dawn what call sunday  dawn after sabbath over    what this means that jesus  using time clarity  grave from 6pm friday night some time before 6am sunday morning   could also little time before 6pm friday  since bible specific here   what this means using jewish time that the grave one  nights  possibly couple hours day   certainly this problem jesus prediction   there absolutely are even able have death involve three days three nights   even using modern time measurements    then led suspect that this error another matthew little mistakes  that gospel writer false words into god mouth    matter made prediction  more than unconvincing    counter convincing   hearing   understanding        jesus tool habit speaking vast audiences parables   stories which deeper meaning could found  were already the elect  those chosen understand message jesus   reasons that those can understand parables the ones wants   people cannot understand them  there need bother with them  since they will accept  plain  message better   matthew says           13 14 16   with them  audience  indeed        fulfilled prophecy isaiah which says            will indeed hear never understand  you        will indeed  never perceive   because this        people heart grown dull  their ears heavy        hearing  they have shut their eyes they        would perceive with them  with their ears         understand with their heart  turn to heal        them    original isaiah passages part earlier works  call ministry   this 740  when israel flourishing  right before falls under authority assyria   isaiah sees good times ending  also vision from  calling bring reform israel judah           6 9 13   d said    say this        people   hear hear  not understand  and         not perceive     make heart this        people  make their ears heavy  shut their        eyes  they will see with their eyes  hear        with their ears  understand with their hearts         turn healed    then isaiah said   long         lord    said   until cities waste        without inhabitant  houses without  the        land utterly desolate  the take far        away  forsaken places many land          though tenth will remain  will burned        again  like terebinth oak whose stump still        stands when tree felled   holy

to israel servant  light nations    look isaiah 42 18 25  48 20  49 3       that matthew cut pasted just little portion isaiah verse  suit own gospel needs   more than that  altered words  make the people didn understand jesus stories    see  isaiah verses not prophecies  rather commands from him  present    once again  matthew prophecy falls flat face         matthew tries again make jesus parables look like they have prophetic approval           13 35      said nothing them without        parable   this fulfil what spoken the        prophet   will open mouth them parables          will utter that which been hidden since        foundation world    matthew really botches here   attempts quote from prophet  from psalms           78 2 4   will open mouth parable   will        utter dark sayings  things that have        heard known  things that fathers have told          will hide them from their children  tell        coming generation glorious deeds        lord     pointed  verses psalms really come from prophet   might also want know that earlier copies matthew gospel even inserted isaiah name this prophet   apparently  later scribes caught error tried cover some       perhaps most significant part this that  once again  matthew altered old testament scriptures   jesus said earlier  speaks parables that some will understand them   parables psalms not hidden   further  they speak things  known  that fathers have told    jesus deals with things  hidden since foundation world    indeed jesus dealt lot secrecy confusion   this direct opposition parables psalms   wonder matthew rewrite them    still once again  matthew artificial prophecies fall flat their face    christians rarely look this   matthew prophecies aren only things about christianity that beginning look    excuses little faith           17 14 21  that disciples able around casting demons  except case   knowing what epilepsy  people thought those with disease were possesed with demons   wonder that disciples were unable  dispossess  epileptic    jesus  perhaps more enlightened than they  reported have rebuked them  saying they didn have enough faith    this seems strange   was this demon special   seems that either true believer faith does   apparently  enough faith will allow someone move mountains   course  will find  these days that move real mountains   parts seas   only miracles charismatics speak those rumoured happen trips mexico some faraway place   major miracles making some woman arthritis feel better sunday morning          the gods  including jesus  always shrouded

seen    dear reader  have seen   literally  know that true   know that presumptuous bold    searching your heart  know what mean    that seen religions make people feel good content about seeing   they our little faith does merit see   sometimes  they   the love these people worship with    the lives people change    that seeing     thus people lulled sleep  satisfied with turning into everyday

beauty created mind   these the things that done  these what    said this only because everybody little faith    jesus rides ass          shortly after accepting role jewish messiah king  jesus requests donkey brought him ride into jerusalem             21 5   this took place fulfil what spoken        prophet  saying          tell daughter zion   behold  your king        coming  humble  mounted ass  a        colt    course  passage quoted from zechariah 9 9 reads little differently           your king comes  triumphant        victorious  humble  riding ass  ass         colt    will command peace nations   there all that much difference here  except that zechariah only involves animal    colt    while matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently   thus  jesus call both colt adult   from matthew version  comical picture divine christ sweating straddle donkeys   this could inevitably lead theological  proctological dilemma    find that account written earlier  mark  only colt called and brought jesus   this indeed fits verses zechariah properly  shows that matthew attempt prophetic verses  bungled    excluding many respectable christians have  have noticed that while christ thought have ridden asses  situation often reversed nowadays            then  entering jerusalem temple  priests were angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah    jesus replied might expect matthew have done           21 16   haven read    the mouth        babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise    more likely that matthew made this response since jesus never point such little  prophetic  things since  might expect  quote error  which seems matthew track record quite well   might jesus matthew   haven read   the source reads           psalms 8 1 2   yahweh lord  majestic        your name whole world     whose glory        chanted above heavens babes infants         have founded bulwark against your foes still        enemy the avenger   passages hardly need comment   there  perfect praise  spoken the psalm  what praise there given  his messiah king  not jesus   mentioned  seems just more case matthew making convenient prophetic scripture   yhvh said  lord            jesus said have asked from whom promised jewish messiah king descended   jews agree   king david    then jesus counters quoting psalms 110           lord said lord  my right hand  until        your enemies under your feet    taken face value  jesus denying necessity davidic descent   assumes opposition their answer   course  christian answer that agrees  trying make some hidden point  reveal some mystery about divine nature messiah king   tempting believe this  a christian not interested matters investigation    there problems         jesus time  psalm thought about messiah    easy why david might refer messiah superior   need only look scriptures about messiah that expected great king  bringing jews times even better than those under david rule   course  jews listening good answer  the passage could indeed refer divine messiah  such christians worship   problem lies meaning this psalm  error that apparently several jews jesus time also made   must remember that there were various factions among jews  often result different expectations messiah king   jesus apparently these adventists  like audience  thought messiah advent imminent  who interpreted psalms 110  among others  being messianic  what problem  then   psalm 110 literally reads          yhvh utterance lord    my right hand  until make your enemies your        footstool           yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion   rule        midst your foes   your people will offer        themselves freely day lead your host        holy mountains             are priest order melchizedek        forever    word  lord  often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity this lord    hebrew  word  adoni   capitalisation exists   adoni simply means  lord   generic term would   used often scriptures refer kings g   merely address respect          there nothing text itself imply that word refers either divinity the messiah king   that this supposed written david certain   title psalm translates either  psalm david    psalm about david    seems fitting assume written court poet  about david covenant endorsement from   psalm been written david  unlikely that would talking about messiah   idea perfect king  descended from david  not present david   have extensive tales david doings sayings   none which include praises messiah       many psalms show evidence being written long after david dead  times exile when had his show favour david kingdom hold         description psalm david very well   david promised a rise power  victory over enemies  successful judgement among nations conquered   achieved priesthood common melchizedek being righteous king  enabled bless people    fits        not have blame this problem matthew alone  though   here  there artificial prophecy alluded  though use scripture rather questionable   still  this event common other gospels    matthew little more easily this time   interesting note  though  matthew dresses event   earlier gospel mark tells tale with jesus simply speaking crowd   matthew the pharisees  became religious competition infant christianity  target jesus question   might expect  matthew writes that event ends embarrassing pharisees   such power pen   moses   jesus  together along             leave gospel story matthew momentarily pseudo prophecy john gospel   gospel story john deserves special treatment  because seems far removed from real events jesus career told even matthew    the moment  will just look verse   early church leaders founded religion jewish hopes messiah king  an artificial extension original promises made   when constructing history abraham  moses wrote promise land nationhood jewish people   while this accomplished eventually  under rule king david  christians came along later decided that they would claim fulfillment promise     they expanded promise  preaching about heavenly kingdom           john 8 56    speaking  your father  abraham         rejoiced day   and glad   would nice approval jesus from abraham   abraham knew nothing jesus messiah  anything christian   have tried  failed find event old testament which corresponds john little prophecy   par the course  john making testament backings  just like forerunner matthew   many christians know that their faith many foundations such fraud  is surprising they still cling   potter field         told that jesus betrayed while jerusalem his followers  judas iscariot    matthew writes           27 5 10   throwing down pieces silver        temple   judas  departed     chief        priests  taking silver  said   lawful        put the treasury  since blood        money    they    bought potter field with        bury strangers    then fulfilled what        spoken prophet jeremiah           they took thirty pieces silver  price        whom price been some        sons israel  they gave them the potter        field  lord directed    this prophecy utterly gross bastardisation testament scripture   first  matthew made mistake regarding name prophet   zechariah utters verses which matthew makes           zech  11 12 13      they weighed wages         thirty shekels silver   then yhvh said   cast        them treasury     lordly price which        paid them   took thirty shekels        silver cast them into treasury house        yhvh   first  verses zechariah deal with betrayer messiah  d   deal with shepherd  most likely priest  chosen serve function presiding over people shortly before would send judah israel into conflict with another   word   treasury   been replaced king james scholars with  potter   precisely because this made matthew quote better    this blatant error   correct translation hebrew indeed  treasury   which also makes perfect sense zechariah context  whereas  potter field  totally unrelated   whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation   however  given matthew track record  finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty        course  matthew would have ample reason altering text   thirty pieces silver match judas situation  as most christians seem  reader willing disregard contextual incongruity  matthew might have another prophecy toss around   however  correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation with judas the high priests   high priests would put money treasury   worthless shepherd zechariah does exactly opposite   course  average thursday night bible student   prophecy  presented matthew would taken testament face value   those  matthew work convincing enough   wine  vinegar    casting lots         then  jesus away crucified           27 34 35      they gave vinegar drink         mingled with gall  when tasted  would        drink    when they crucified  they        divided garments among them casting lots  that        might fulfilled what spoken prophet           they parted garments among them  upon        vesture they cast lots    first  vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine  type that roman soldiers drank regularly   find that right before jesus dies  soldiers themselves give some drink   polluted with gall           19 28 30   jesus    said   thirst    bowl        vinegar stood there  they sponge full        vinegar hyssop held his mouth   when        received vinegar  said   finished     matthew seems drawing  passage from prophets  one from psalms           69 20 28   looked pity  there none         for comforters  found none   they gave        poison food   they gall meat          thirst  they gave vinegar drink            them punishment upon punishment  they have        acquittal from thee   them blotted the        book living   course  sour wine offered jesus done request drink   this does indeed seem show pity   psalm quoted about david his political military enemies   not about messiah jesus   then surprising that into further problem when that  jesus  psalm asks for damnation  crucifiers   whereas jesus gospels says           23 34   jesus said   father  forgive them         know what they    further  matthew misses with attempt create prophecy having gall  bitter substance  into jesus drink  his meat  psalm stipulates          with  prophecy  vinegar faulty  naturally   what casting lots    this brings 22nd psalm  which deserves discussion itself   suffice say that fact that jesus clothes were divided told great thing   turns that this happened often felon those days   will soon  perhaps least erroneous passage psalm when applied jesus   does indeed bring interesting question the quality jesus clothes   man removed from worldly possessions  ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises some suspicions   22nd psalm         this psalm attributed david  lament condition under attack enemies   becomes song praise yhvh hope   taken context  parts seem the plight jesus crucifixion quite well   will examine primary passages          verse 1 2     have forsaken           are far from helping  from words        groaning     day  you        answer  night  find rest   jesus said have cried first sentence while cross   this suggests that whole psalm really about jesus  rather than king david   course  rest first stanza does fit nicely jesus execution   jesus pictured complaining about whole ordeal  supposed like  lamb mute before shearers    indeed  jesus doesn much groaning  even when cross   certainly does cry both and night cross          6 8    worm  man   scorned            who mock   they make faces wag        their heads    committed cause yhvh          deliver    delights    this seems jesus execution pretty well  with exception holy messiah being called worm          12 13   many bulls encompass    they open their        mouths widely like ravening roaring lion          16 18    dogs round about  company        evildoers encir  they have pierced hands        feet   see bones    they divide        garments among them  cast lost raiment          19 21   you  yhvh  far away      deliver        soul from sword  life from power          save from mouth lion         afflicted soul from horns wild bull   would seem quite convincing  m sure early christian fathers wrote this prophecy thought   unfortunately  this prophecy fatal flaw   words  have pierced  really exist psalm   correct hebrew translation          16    dogs round about  company        evildoers encircles  like lion  they my        hands feet     hebrew phrase  like lion  very rare verb form which mean  pierced  differ phonetic character   word hebrew text literally   like lion     which makes sense context  even further fits animal imagery employed psalm writer   convenience that would urge christian change word       the needed  artificial  weight  prophecy  this just what christian translators have chosen   while correct translation does eliminate psalm from referring jesus  absence does say much the honesty translators          apart from erroneous verse 16  psalm does lend itself jesus easily   verse 20 speaks sufferer being saved from sword rather than cross   this naturally fits psalm true subject  king david   side note  know that crucifixions not pierce hands  palms  rather forearms   this doesn much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms   then  facts aren bound religious beliefs         matthew escapes culpability this time  does attempt draw many direct links between this psalm his lord jesus   the psalm  like many others  the minds the gospel writers when they compiled stories interpretations jesus life death   much these scriptures have contributed what actually written down question that serious repercussions christian theology   easy  those are faithful fundamentalists  some events new testament might have been  enhanced  scribes such eager matthew    does less speculate than simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims    this not said good things  matthew   reference piercing looks like jesus crucifixion   john gospel recount  written about 70 years after fact  tells jesus execution           19 34 37   one soldiers pierced        side with spear  out came blood water           these things took place that scripture fulfilled            will look whom they pierced    course  this built passage taken blatantly context    prophet zechariah tells much nation israel will split from jerusalem judah to with them           12 7 10   yhvh will give victory judah           that  will seek destroy nations        that come against jerusalem  judah    will        pour spirit compassion supplication           jerusalem that when they look who they have        pierced  they will mourn  weep bitterly over        like weep over firstborn child   john attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker that matthew attempts   matthew  least  usually excontexts more than just passage   john errors grossly obvious blatant here   does speak well any gospel writers  helps show the prophetic aspects their religion were founded     reckoned with transgressors          after arrest  jesus quickly executed claiming jewish kingship  messiahship    according version gospel tale  jesus gets executed along with thieves           15 27   with they crucified robbers         his right  his left   the        scripture fulfilled which says           reckoned with transgressors    here  mark trying link jesus passage isaiah 53  about servant nation israel   passage about messiah  one reads whole chapter isaiah 53  its surrounding chapters  sees that servant nation   verses also about what this servant gone through past  prediction what come  event   servant thought criminal   this also happens the description jesus   the passage really been about messiah  still all clear executing jesus between thieves would fulfill  prophecy  isaiah   jesus would more fittingly fulfill with whole ministry   considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career    locking onto single event rather poor steal prophecy  least this case  see that mark could have made better analogy with general comparisons          mark goes tell  those were crucified with  jesus  also reviled    15 32   this expected from couple robbers   course later recount   luke decides change some things   luke tells           23 39 43   one criminals was hanged        with railed   aren the messiah   save        yourself     this certainly fits with mark recount  which tells the people crucified jesus said   save yourself   that robbers the same   then luke goes          the other  criminal  rebuked  first  saying          you fear  since are under same        sentence condemnation    indeed justly         are receiving due reward our deeds           this has done nothing wrong  said          jesus  remember when come your kingdom           jesus answered   verily you  today        will with paradise     this little dialogue seems highly contrived   stretches imagination see this picture ruffian rebuking fellow criminal with such eloquent speech   have rather strange picture criminal lamenting over goodness punishment the justness suffering    such  apparently noble principle  doesn seem likely have been robber   wonder amount theatrics created luke   course  luke recount also disagrees with mark    luke only criminal revile jesus  both   easy enough discount discrepancy because account made  those wish believe all part error free words do have this avenue open   this another example writer trying take testament passage expand reinterpret suit theology   this case  embroidery creates some embarrassing problems  have seen   end world           24          comes perhaps the most extraordinary embarrassing passages new testament   found three synoptic gospel stories  casts some most unfavourable doubt whole theory christianity   jesus mentions destruction jewish temples buildings  his disciples him about this  about end world which been warning about          disciples  tell  when will this  temple        destruction   what will sign your        coming  the close age          jesus  take care that leads astray         many will come name  saying   the christ               will hear wars rumours wars           this must take place  the not            nation will rise against nation    this the        beginning birthpangs               they will deliver    you death         false prophets will arise lead many astray            who endures end will saved   this        gospel will preached throughout whole world         testimony nations  then end will come                when see desolation spoken the        prophet daniel     those are judea flee        mountains                immediately after tribulation those days         sun will darkened    stars will fall

that jesus thought world would within lifetimes least some disciples   tells them that although doesn know exact hour  that will come  thus they must ready   theologians have their pants panic find some out this holy error    unfortunately  jesus made himself explicit   told disciples that their generation would still around end  that they particular should prepare  prepare swept away        there have been some resorted removing inerrant nature bible  said that phrase   this generation shall pass away     really means  this race people will pass away      course  word generation used many times refer exactly that  generation disciples   interesting notion that when decided learn greek  didn learn well enough make himself clear    quite obvious from rest dialogue that disciples  least some them  supposed live end world   charge mistranslation completely blown away looking apostles  responses   becomes abundantly clear from  22 7  1 peter 4 7  1 john 2 18  rev  22 20  that jesus meant exactly what said   end very near          2 000 years  christians have rationalised this 24th chapter matthew  ignored meaning altogether   2 000 years  they have waited their executed

less trouble   seen again  resurrected  glowing with divine radiance   then saviour decided wasn the best interests new religion stick around  therefore disappeared from sight into heaven   story goes  anyway   been seen  there were many things attributed jesus when people around writing gospel stories down   them  jesus the fulfiller prophecy scripture   have seen  though  that this matter quite shaky    throughout church history  christians have held fast faith  simple belief   what doctrinal objections could solved with argumentation brute force  faith forgetfulness kept away from question   question investigate never been easiest treat matters   thus 2 000 years  prophecies cited new testament have gone largely accepted   things well continue that for some time   pausing moment consider way doctrines christianity have been accepted used  properly improperly  support wars persecution  suppose there prophecy which christianity securely keep hold ',\n",

       " 'mr decenso  spite requiring scholarly opinion hanging judas  rejects that scholarly opinion those scholars then rephrases those scholars opinion subject       actually  further research the greek word  apacgw   will find that does denote success   those scholars indeed have excellent reason assume that suicide successful   pointed  recently checked several lexicons     greek english lexicon new testament   louw nida   robinson greek english lexicon new testament    greek english lexicon new testament   grimm   word study concordance   tynsdale   greek english lexicon new testament other    early christian writings   bauer arndt gingrich   new analytical greek lexicon   perschbacher  couple simply stated  hanged oneself   couple were more explicit  stated that  apacgw  means specifically  kill yourself hanging   couple also noted that meaning the root words  apacgw   strangle  throttle choke   which pretty much invalidates guy suggested david joslin that judas hung upside down    the best references though   robinson greek english lexicon new testament   only stated translation  gave both root words  literal translation  related greek words which the same roots  also other presented specific examples word greek literature  give further context      word  apagchw  two root words   gchw   strangle  root  the root word   means literally  away   this root words included words which denote transition   mean transition place   greek word  apagello  means send message      also denote change state specifically change from life death   robinson specifically makes comparison word  apokteiuo   which means  kill   literal meaning word  apacgw  means  throttle  strangle out way   implicitly denotes change life state   away from life  death    while word  apacgw  does mean  hang   specifically denotes death well   thus robinson quite specific when state that means  hang oneself  one life hanging   then notes the  apacgw  homers odessy 19 230 denote context   presents that example  apacgw  being used explicitly mean  suicide hanging   since there perfectly good word strangling  without added denotation  death   you insist that bible written  every word precicely correct  are stuck with complete meaning  apacgw    since word  apacgw  used  then death denoted result     way  note that decenso also presents example  apacgw     note decenso  say  septuagint translation from hebrew greek  you have shown original meaning hebrew   the hebrew  died    thus whether simply echoed greek   should also pointed that  regardless added  died   correct translation would still  apacgw   man indeed from strangulation  redundant  correct    further  have evidence that septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited  which included versions which contradicted each other   such editing not even necessarily executed greeks   thus not sure that can the septuagint now stands  paragon ancient greek    what really need prove your point decenso  example  ancient greek  someone committing  apacgw  surviving   otherwise would you simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence    would note decenso  that everytime out way research your apparently contrived exegisis  pretty much find false   thus  think that are going the text  something over above what source clearly says  then had better have explicit greek historical source justify    way  rose statement about trees around potter field    unless rose show that these trees two thousand years  that there 2000 year stumps there  2 thousand year description area which mentions such trees  then inappropriate him assert that present placement trees prove location trees thousand years  after  things change     to your other argument   that money judas used the same 30 silvers    true  peter  author acts  does specifically call judas  betrayal  iniquity   for that matter  neither does john specifically call judas  actions  iniquity  either   further john 13 29 not that judas took       some thought that because  judas the money  jesus telling       what need the feast   that should give something      poor  after receiving morsel immediately went       night    note that said that judas left  does say that took money   thus when your explanation still seems you would choose an unproven iniquity  mentioned another author  different book  written different time  over iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts   find this forced contrived    course this particular argument becomes moot  since have have seen evidence that  apacgw  means suicide   see  since judas  hanging successful  could have spent money mentioned john 13 29  because matthew mark explicitly the betrayal the high holy   passover   thus could have spent money before killing himself next   thus money which bought  field blood  would have have been 30 pieces silver  course the 30 pieces silver that night well  thus couldn have spent that either   dear  believe that house cards
